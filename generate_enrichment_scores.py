    # "When you run the gene set enrichment analysis, the GSEA software automatically normalizes
    # the enrichment scores for variation in gene set size, as described in GSEA Statistics.
    # Nevertheless, the normalization is not very accurate for extremely small or extremely
    # large gene sets. For example, for gene sets with fewer than 10 genes, just 2 or 3 genes
    # can generate significant results. Therefore, by default, GSEA ignores gene sets that
    # contain fewer than 25 genes or more than 500 genes; defaults that are appropriate for
    # datasets with 10,000 to 20,000 features. To change these default values, use the Max Size
    # and Min Size parameters on the Run GSEA Page; however, keep in mind the possibility of
    # inflated scorings for very small gene sets and inaccurate normalization for large ones."
